# ISP-Othello

Implementation of an adversarial search algorithm for the game Othello. It is required to implement the Minimax-algorithm 
with alpha-beta pruning. The computer’s response time on a board with 8 columns and 8 rows should be ”reasonable”, meaning that 
on average, response time should be less than 10 seconds although few moves up to 30 seconds would be acceptable. Moreover, the 
implementation should be able to beat the provided DumAI consistently.

Extensions: Implement a cutoff and eval function
