# Minimax

Assignment in Intelligent Systems programming. Implementation of an adversarial search algorithm for the game Othello
developed with Anders Fleron & Line Bay Kreiberg.

Requirements: 
- implement the minimax-algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- implement a cutoff and eval-function such that the computer’s response time on a board with 8 columns 
  and 8 rows should be ”reasonable”, meaning that on average, response time should be less than 10 seconds although few moves up 
  to 30 seconds would be acceptable
- the implementation should be able to beat the provided DumAI consistently.
